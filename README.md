# clojure-dojo

This is my personal space for practicing and learning how to program,
specifically using Clojure.  This is my personal coding dojo.

## Understanding Computation

I am working through [Understanding Computation](http://computationbook.com/).
As I read the book, I am translating the examples from Ruby to Clojure.

Here is an example:

```clojure
;; in clojure-dojo.computation.simple

(run (machine (assign :x (add (variable :x) (number 1))) {:x (number 2)}))

```
